# SWOT analysis

This document summarizes the project's internal Strengths and Weaknesses and the external Opportunities and Threats, then derives actionable strategies and SMART next steps.

## Strengths (S)

- Solid foundational knowledge of programming concepts.
- Comfortable reading and comprehending English technical documentation and examples.
- Broad language/tool familiarity: C/C++, C#, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, Python — enabling rapid prototyping with the best-fit tool.

## Weaknesses (W)

- Tendency to procrastinate and inconsistent work cadence.
- Limited focus on sustained, long-running tasks.

## Opportunities (O)

- Access to high-quality online resources and AI-assisted research to accelerate learning and problem solving.
- Sufficient time before graduation to complete meaningful project milestones if work is scheduled consistently.

## Threats (T)

- Risk of development taking longer than planned due to scope creep or inconsistent effort.

## Strategy matrix (S/O, W/O, W/T, S/T)

### S/O — Use strengths to exploit opportunities

1. Just-in-time learning: when a feature is required, search authoritative documentation and implement a minimal prototype the same day to lock knowledge in.
2. Rapid prototyping: pick familiar languages/tools for prototypes to validate ideas quickly and reduce time-to-feedback.
3. Learning-linked milestones: attach a short learning objective to each milestone (e.g., "implement image embedding while adding the post editor") so time-before-graduation becomes focused learning.

### W/O — Use opportunities to overcome weaknesses

1. Timeboxing and cadence: adopt Pomodoro-style work blocks (25–50 minutes) and publish a weekly plan with 3 top priorities to convert inconsistent effort into predictable progress.
2. Micro-learning with AI: use curated AI prompts and short tutorials to fill gaps rapidly instead of long, unfocused study sessions.
3. Visible commitments: create issues and checklists in the repo for each small deliverable to reduce procrastination through visibility and incremental wins.

### W/T — Minimize weaknesses to reduce exposure to threats

1. Minimize scope per sprint: split work into small, testable increments to avoid long, risky development cycles.
2. Automate scaffolding and tests: add basic templates and unit-test skeletons to cut repetitive work and lower the activation energy for coding days.
3. Accountability and buffers: keep short daily logs or GitHub comments and schedule buffer days in the plan to handle unexpected blockers.

### S/T — Use strengths to mitigate threats

1. Prefer proven libraries and patterns found in documentation to reduce time spent reinventing solutions.
2. Use familiar languages for critical paths to reduce debugging and integration time.
3. Validate solutions with small experiments before full implementation to catch costly mistakes early.
