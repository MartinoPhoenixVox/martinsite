# Project Documentation

This folder holds structured documentation that follows the development flow used by this project:

PLANNING → ANALYSIS → DESIGN → IMPLEMENTATION → MAINTENANCE

Each file below is a living template you should duplicate or edit when starting a feature or change. Keep diagrams (UML/ER) in `website/static/docs/` for easy referencing from templates and pages.

Files:
- `1-planning.md` — Planning template and goals
- `2-analysis.md` — Analysis notes, constraints, and data model
- `3-design.md` — Architecture, ER diagrams, and UI sketches
- `4-implementation.md` — Tasks, branches, tests, and deployment notes
- `5-maintenance.md` — Post-deploy monitoring, known issues, and backlog

Guidelines
- Name files clearly and include a date and owner in each document.
- Version diagrams as `v1`, `v2` in `website/static/docs/` (e.g. `er_diagram_v1.png`).
- For large binary diagrams, consider Git LFS or external storage and link from these markdown files.
